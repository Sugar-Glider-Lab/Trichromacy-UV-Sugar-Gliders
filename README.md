Title: Trichromacy and Ultraviolet Vision in a Nocturnal Australo-Papuan Marsupial: The Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps)

Summary: The colour vision of the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), a nocturnal, gliding mammal, was examined through a series of behavioral tests, genetic analyses, and immunohistochemistry. Sugar gliders demonstrated trichromacy and ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, the latter of which was further supported by genetic analysis. Visualization of the sugar glider retina exhibited a rod-dominant retina that expresses rhodopsin, short-wavelength sensitive 1 opsin, and long/medium-wavelength sensitive opsin. Diurnal primates were thought to be the only mammals able to visualize trichromatically, however the results of this examination and evidence from a few other marsupial studies provide support for nocturnal trichromacy in Metatheria. Our results are evidence of a fourth Australian marsupial that is UV-trichromatic, supporting complex spectral sensitivity and UV vision as benefits to survival in nocturnal environments
